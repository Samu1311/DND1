# UI Development for Mobile Health App

## Overview
As part of the ongoing development of the *Mobile Health App for Skin and Medical Image Analysis*, the user interface (UI) plays a critical role in ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for users. The UI is designed to enable users to interact with features like mole tracking, image analysis, and health alerts while maintaining accessibility and responsiveness across devices.

Below is a summary of the progress made in designing and implementing the app's UI.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. *Home Page Layout*

The *Home Page* serves as the central hub for the app, providing users with quick access to its core features through a visually appealing and responsive button grid.

- *Feature Icons Grid*:
  - An 8x8 grid layout was implemented to accommodate buttons of various sizes.
  - Each grid item represents a key feature:
    - *Health Overview*
    - *Mole Tracking*
    - *Image Analysis*
    - *Alerts*
  - Buttons dynamically adjust to screen sizes, ensuring responsiveness on both desktop and mobile.

- *Emergency Call Button*:
  - A prominent button at the bottom of the page allows users to quickly access emergency services.
  - Styled for visibility and ease of use, it supports icons for visual clarity.

### 2. *Search Bar*

To enhance usability, a *search bar* was added to allow users to quickly navigate through app functionalities or search for specific information:
- Positioned at the top of the Home Page.
- Styled with rounded corners and padding for a modern look.

### 3. *Dynamic Navigation Menu*

The *NavMenu* serves as a collapsible navigation bar, providing access to key sections of the app, such as:
- Home
- Login
- Image Upload
- Image Library

- *Responsive Design*:
  - The navigation bar is fully responsive, collapsing into a toggleable menu on smaller screens while expanding for desktop users.
  - Built using *Bootstrap 5*, it ensures compatibility across devices.

- *Custom Styling*:
  - A dark blue theme (#004085) was used to maintain a professional and clean aesthetic.
  - Links feature smooth hover effects and active state indicators, enhancing the user experience.

### 4. *Footer*

A simple yet functional *footer* has been added to provide contextual information, such as copyright notices:
- Includes a centered text displaying the copyright for the app.
- Styled to stay at the bottom of the page, even with minimal content on the screen.

## Key Technologies and Tools

- *Blazor Components*:
  - Leveraged Blazor’s component-based architecture to build reusable and maintainable UI components.
- *Bootstrap 5*:
  - Used for responsive grid layouts, navigation bar styling, and overall consistency in UI design.
- *Blazorise*:
  - Integrated Blazorise for advanced UI features like styled buttons and grids.
- *Custom CSS*:
  - Developed custom styles to align with the app’s branding and ensure a unique, polished look.

## Challenges and Next Steps

### Challenges Faced
1. *Grid Item Alignment*:
   - Initial issues with centering images inside grid items were resolved by integrating Flexbox and properly scoping CSS to ensure consistent behavior across components.

2. *Navigation Styling Conflicts*:
   - Default Bootstrap styles for navigation links (e.g., text-primary) were overriding custom styles. This was addressed by increasing CSS specificity and using !important where necessary.

### Next Steps
- *Implementing Interactive Features*:
  - Dynamic alerts and health-related notifications will be integrated into the UI.
  - Image upload and preview functionality will be enhanced for user convenience.

- *Multifactor Authentication UI*:
  - Design screens for implementing two-factor authentication as part of the login process.
