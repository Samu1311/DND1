# Project Formulation & Requirements

## Project Formulation

### Mobile Health App for Skin and Medical Image Analysis

This mobile app will be developed to help patients track changes in their skin's appearance, particularly in monitoring moles, lesions, or other skin conditions, as well as enabling the user to analyze medical images such as MRI or CT scans.

The goal is to empower users with tools that can track potential skin-related health issues over time and help with preliminary analysis of medical scans, enabling early detection and more informed doctor visits.

### Core Features:
1. **Mole and Lesion Tracking**:
   - Allow users to take pictures of their moles or lesions regularly.
   - Track changes in size, shape, and color over time.
   - Store previous images for comparison.

2. **Medical Image Analysis**:
   - Allow users to upload or take a picture of MRI or CT scans.
   - Use image processing to identify and highlight areas of interest.

3. **Health Alerts**:
   - Send alerts if significant changes in skin or medical images are detected.
   - Provide reminders to regularly check or update mole tracking images.

4. **Patient Education**:
   - Offer educational material related to skin health and common issues detected through image analysis.
   - Provide explanations of MRI and CT scan regions.

5. **Data Privacy and Security**:
   - Ensure all images and personal health data are encrypted and stored securely.
   - Allow users to share their analysis results directly with healthcare providers securely.

## Requirements

### User Requirements (Non-Technical):
1. **User Interface and Usability**:
   - Clear visual feedback: Display results and recommendations in a clear, non-technical format (e.g., green for no issues, yellow for changes detected, red for concerning changes).
   - Registration: Users should be able to register with basic details (name, email, password).
   - Accessibility: Users should be able to edit their profile and medical history information.

2. **Image Capture and Storage**:
   - Capture and save skin images: Users should be able to take a picture of a mole or lesion and save it for future analysis.
   - Store image history: The app should maintain a history of captured images, enabling users to see how their mole or lesion has changed over time for comparison and tracking progression.

3. **Medical Image Upload and Analysis**:
   - Simple image upload: Users should be able to upload MRI or CT scan images directly from their phone or import them from other sources (e.g., emails, cloud storage).
   - Automated analysis: The app should analyze MRI or CT images to detect potential areas of interest or abnormalities, marking them visually (e.g., circles or highlights on areas).
   - Non-expert feedback: Provide results in a format that is understandable by non-experts, along with a recommendation to consult a doctor if needed.

4. **Health Alerts and Notifications**:
   - Reminders for mole tracking: The app should notify users at regular intervals (e.g., every month) to retake images of their skin moles for consistent tracking.
   - Alerts for significant changes: If the app detects a significant change in a moleâ€™s size, shape, or color, or an anomaly in a medical image, it should alert the user immediately.
   - Educational alerts: Send educational notifications about skin health, such as early signs of melanoma or tips on how to self-check for skin issues.

5. **Data Privacy and Security**:
   - Secure storage: Ensure all data, including images, are encrypted and stored securely.
   - Controlled sharing: Provide users with options to securely share their results with healthcare professionals.
